# Reviving Old Games for The New Generation

Welcome to the "Reviving Old Games for The New Generation" project! In this repository, we bring back some classic games that have been loved for generations and give them a modern touch to be enjoyed by today's players. This menu-driven interface allows users to choose from four classic games: Connect 4, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Hangman (Avengers Version), and Mad Libs.

## Games Included

1. **Connect 4**
   Connect 4 is a classic two-player connection board game. Players take turns dropping their respective characters (X or O) into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The game utilizes if-else loops, variable counters, and condition loops to determine the positions of the characters and declare a winner when four identical symbols are aligned vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

2. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
   Rock, Paper, Scissors is a fun terminal-based game. The rules are simple: the computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the user inputs their choice. The game uses Python's random module and conditional statements to determine the winner based on the selected items.

3. **Hangman (Avengers Version)**
   Hangman is a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess letters (A-Z) to complete the word. In this Avengers-themed version, the user must guess the name of any Avenger character. The game incorporates the random module to select a character and employs multiple if-else statements to compare the user's input with the letters in the chosen word.

4. **Mad Libs**
   Mad Libs is a creative and humorous game. Users are prompted to enter specific words like nouns, adverbs, verbs, foods, adjectives, etc., and then a story is generated using their inputs. The game utilizes Python's random module to select from various pre-defined stories and multiple input statements to create a fun-filled paragraph that will bring a smile to the user's face.
